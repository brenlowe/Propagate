# E-Commerce Project Site Built with React

Technologies used: HTML, TailWind CSS, JS, React, React Router.

This is a functional multi-page website with a working shopping cart, products, and components.
I wanted to challenge myself into creating a mockup of something from scratch using a different workflow than I'm used to. Inspiration for the site design comes from https://bloomscape.com/.
