# E-Commerce Project Site Built with React

Technologies used: HTML, TailWind CSS, JS, React, React Router.

This is a full CRUD multi-page website with a working shopping cart, products, and components.

I wanted to challenge myself into creating a mockup of something from scratch using common React workflows while learning and utilizing Tailwind. 

Inspiration for the site design comes from https://bloomscape.com/.
