#### Technologies used: React, TailWind, JS, React, React Router
# Propagate Site
### Multi-page site with custom modals, shopping cart and product functionality.

This is an custom website clone based on Bloomscapes website as my muse (https://bloomscape.com). 
I wanted to recreate a website using modern React workflows while learning Tailwind and using minimal custom css. I created my own custom components and modals while learning how to manipulate React Hooks and useState to produce functionality.
